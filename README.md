# TypeScript Modules

TypeScript has three different module systems: internal, external and ES6.
They use different syntax and solve different problems. They also
represent different steps int he evolution of the language.

This repo demonstrates some minimal use cases of the different module
systems and shows a few other ramifications and related concepts, such as
the relationship with the `tsconfig.json` file.

## Using the Demos

To get started, run `npm install`.

Each sample has its own `README.md` file. It explains the sample and
provides instructions on how to run it and verify its results. The
verifications are not automatic; you have to open the output files and
take a look at the results.
